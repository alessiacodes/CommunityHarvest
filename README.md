## Inspiration 💡
As climate change continues to disrupt traditional growing seasons and worsen extreme weather events, the stability of our food systems becomes increasingly uncertain. We understand the importance of achieving food security for many individuals and families as these global challenges continue to persist. Our inspiration lies behind the importance of achieving food justice and finding sustainable solutions to combat the unpredictable effects of natural disasters in the agriculture world. Community Harvest is our response to empower unity within local communities and strengthen their food systems that aids us to create a more sustainable future for many generations to come. 

## What it does 🍎
Community Harvest connects green-thumbed community members- whether farmers by trade or gardeners by hobby- who want to donate any surplus from their harvest, to willing recipients. And these roles are not fixed either; anyone can choose to receive any of the donated surplus, whether they are donors or not. Users also have the option to swap produce with their neighbors to reduce food waste in their community.

## How we built it 👩🏻‍💻
We built Community Harvest using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Our frontend was built with HTML and CSS with a UI Figma for our app prototype. As for the backend, we used JavaScript and Node.js.

## Challenges we ran into 🙃
Given our limited knowledge in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, we found it challenging to pick up a new language in such a short amount of time. It took quite a bit of research and effort to accomplish simple functionalities of our program.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of 🏆
We are proud that we were ultimately able to build a viable product despite our skill limitations. Even though certain planned features still need to be implemented, we are proud of the features we did make and are glad we gained experience in new languages and styling tools.

## What we learned 🏫
JavaScript, HTML, and CSS

## What's next for Community Harvest ⏭️
As our technical skills expand, we hope to implement the remaining features found in our Figma mockup. This includes a chat function for Community Harvest so that users can communicate about listings, categories for produce postings, and a review system to verify donors. Together with this, we aim to give users a better experience by implementing the app in React for a more ease-free and eye catching appearance transition.
